## This is a markdown file

This is the answer to the third question of the assignment for the first course of the John Hopkins specialization, the introductory course: __The Data Science Toolbox.__

The task is to create this markdown file, name it HelloWorld.me, and Push the document to the datasciencecoursera repo I have just created on Github.

For doing these I follow this steps:

* Create the document with the correct markdown syntax
* Name it as HelloWord.md
* Add that file name to Git index with git add HelloWorld.md
